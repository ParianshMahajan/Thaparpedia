# Thaparpedia

IDEA :: 

It is a platform named Thaparpedia. Its basically for the college students to help them in their academics and for easy and unified access of everything. Some peer of us get misguided and get panic as they come to college. Especially freshers and some introverts who avoid being open up and lacks communication skills..

So this platform have two sections :: 1).Academic 2).Career

1).In academics, (An upgraded version of myherupa) :: in this we will provide facilities such as notes, tutes, solutions, books, video lecs, previous papers, syllabus at a unified place + cutoff of different subjects which makes it easier to calculate Gpa (Also a Gpa Calculator)  + Guidance section for academics (as per recommended by toppers (tips and tricks))  + a QnA section for students 
(only some limited user are allowed to message )…  It really going to help students who get panic as week before exams so that they get proper roadmap and notes so that they can achieve good marks in very less time + they don't have to go to other people for advise  like "kaise karoon kucch ho nhi rha"

2). Career section
One of the unique section of our platform which is really going to help the freshers. Some students have good caliber to code but due to lack of awareness and guidance they get trapped into the academic trap and can't polish their skills..
This section will provide an Overview "Like Mostly what students prefer what industry demands so that they can set their goals"
+ different fields and their roadmaps + courses links for free + preferences like which course from where is good for a particular field so that they do not waste their time +
giving them guidance to get them ready for corporate world. Because many people don't even know what is linkedIn or hackerrank  +
A timeline roadmap like "Most of students finish this task or course in this time" So that they don't get panic when they see someone more skilled than them as many of them loses hope 

The main motive of this platform is to provide everything unified like they don't have to go to youtube or any other platform ,to avoid mislead and misguidance and panic



GUIDE ::

To start the project :: Open both the folders in  code editor with two different workspaces
Install all the packages using npm
Open the terminal and type "npm start"
DO the same sateps with both folders and make sure the website will run on link "[https/](http://localhost:3000/)"
whereas the server will run on the link "http://127.0.0.1:7000" 
And at final the pdfs will open on the server link because the data has been stored in server's folders
